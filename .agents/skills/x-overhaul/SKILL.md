# Hotmint Full Codebase Audit-Fix-Commit Pipeline

Resolve repository paths from the Git root; Markdown links are relative to
this file. Read invocation arguments from the user prompt. This explicit
invocation authorizes the local fix commits produced by the pipeline.

## Phase 1: Full Codebase Review

Execute the full audit protocol of [x-review](../x-review/SKILL.md) with the
`all` scope:

1. Load the skills' required documentation
   (`docs/ai/technical-patterns.md`, `docs/ai/review-core.md`,
   `docs/ai/false-positive-guide.md`).
2. Perform the Full Audit Protocol: one reviewer per subsystem group (read
   all its source files, load the matching pattern guide), deep analysis of
   invariants, boundary conditions, failure paths, concurrency, and unsafe
   blocks.
3. Aggregate and deduplicate all findings.
4. Manage `docs/audit.md` — prune fixed entries, merge new findings sorted
   by severity.

## Phase 2: Fix & Commit

Execute the full [x-fix](../x-fix/SKILL.md) protocol, including its
self-review and commit phases:

1. Read `docs/audit.md`.
2. Fix, validate, update the registry, self-review the aggregate diff, and
   commit per that skill.
3. Iterate until `docs/audit.md` has zero open entries (or only Won't Fix).

Do not push, tag, amend, or rewrite history.
