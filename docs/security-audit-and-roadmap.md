## 1. Executive Summary

| Dimension | CometBFT v0.38 | Hotmint v0.8 |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Language | Go | Rust |
| Consensus Algorithm | Tendermint (three-phase BFT) | HotStuff-2 (two-chain commit BFT) |
| Maturity | Production-grade, primary engine of Cosmos ecosystem | Architecturally complete, core feature parity achieved, entering production hardening phase |
| Core Strengths | Complete ecosystem, rich toolchain, mature protocol | Lower latency, more modular architecture, memory safety |
| Main Weaknesses | Three-phase voting latency, Go GC tail-latency jitter | Missing IBC cross-chain protocol; ecosystem tooling still maturing |

Hotmint's combination of **Rust + HotStuff-2 + litep2p** gives it the potential to surpass CometBFT in core consensus algorithm and architectural modernization. All security vulnerabilities and engineering defects from all three audit rounds have been resolved (C-1..C-7, H-1..H-12, R-1, A-1..A-8, B-1..B-3, second-round C-1..C-5, third-round A3-1..A3-12). All feature roadmap items are complete. Core feature parity with CometBFT has been achieved — the only remaining gap is:
- **Ecosystem Expansion Layer:** IBC cross-chain protocol (infrastructure ready, protocol not implemented)

## 13. Feature Evolution Items

All security vulnerabilities and engineering defects from all three audit rounds have been resolved. The items below document the completed feature roadmap.

---

### 🟢 P0 — Feature Evolution: Production Chain Essentials

#### [x] P0-1. Standard HTTP/WebSocket RPC + Event Subscription ✅

`HttpRpcServer` (`crates/hotmint-api/src/http_rpc.rs`) provides axum HTTP `POST /` + WS `GET /ws` with event bus, `SubscribeFilter`, and all standard RPC methods. The node binary starts it conditionally on `config.rpc.http_laddr` (`crates/hotmint/src/bin/node.rs:478-494`). The legacy TCP `RpcServer` remains for CLI tooling compatibility.

---

### 🟢 P1 — Feature Evolution: Network Robustness

#### [x] P1-1. Snapshot State Sync (State Sync via Snapshots) ✅

All 4 `Application` trait methods (`list_snapshots`, `load_snapshot_chunk`, `offer_snapshot`, `apply_snapshot_chunk`) are implemented. `sync_to_tip()` calls `sync_via_snapshot()` automatically when the catch-up gap exceeds `MAX_SYNC_BATCH` (`crates/hotmint-consensus/src/sync.rs:83-103`). The snapshot trust anchor is verified by fetching the signed anchor block and performing full QC aggregate-signature + quorum checks before adopting any snapshot state (`sync.rs:333-391`). The node binary serves snapshot chunks to peers and the sync client path is fully wired.

---

#### [x] P1-2. Weighted Proposer Selection `[Missing Feature]` ✅

**Current Gap:** `view % validator_count` does not consider staking weight, making it unfair for non-uniform stake distributions.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Enable the `voting_power` field in `ValidatorSet`
- Implement a CometBFT-style weighted round-robin algorithm (increment each validator's priority score proportionally to `voting_power`, select the highest scorer as proposer)
- Maintain backward compatibility with the existing Epoch structure

**Key Files:** `crates/hotmint-consensus/src/leader.rs`, `crates/hotmint-types/src/validator.rs`

---

### 🟢 P2 — Feature Evolution: Ecosystem Expansion

#### [x] P2-1. Light Client Verification Protocol `[Missing Feature]` ✅

**Current Gap:** Cannot support IBC cross-chain communication or trustless verification on mobile wallets.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Design a light client verification path based on existing `QuorumCertificate` (already contains 2f+1 aggregate signatures)
- `get_block` RPC optionally returns `commit_qc` + Merkle proof
- Add a `verify_header` RPC (verifies only QC signatures and validator set changes)
- Provide a standalone `hotmint-light` crate for third-party integration

**Key Files:** `crates/hotmint-api/`, `crates/hotmint-types/src/certificate.rs`

> **Implementation Status: ✅ Complete.** `hotmint-light` crate (`LightClient` + `verify_header` + `update_validator_set`, with unit tests); RPC `get_header` / `get_commit_qc` methods; MPT state proof verification via vsdb `MptProof` fully wired.

---

#### [x] P2-2. ABCI++ Vote Extensions `[Missing Feature]`

**Current Gap:** Cannot implement built-in oracles, threshold signature aggregation, or anti-MEV mechanisms.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Add `extension: Option<Vec<u8>>` to the `Vote` struct
- Add two application callbacks before the `Vote2` phase:
  ```rust
  fn extend_vote(&self, block: &Block, ctx: &BlockContext) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;
  fn verify_vote_extension(&self, ext: &[u8], validator: ValidatorId) -> bool;
  ```
- Aggregate all validators' extensions in the `Double Certificate`
- The next round's `create_payload` can read the previous round's extension set

**Key Files:** `crates/hotmint-types/src/message.rs`, `crates/hotmint-consensus/src/view_protocol.rs`

> **Implementation Status: ✅ Complete.** `Vote.extension: Option<Vec<u8>>` field, `extend_vote()` / `verify_vote_extension()` callbacks, engine calls `extend_vote` before Vote2, `verify_vote_extension` called on receipt. Extensions are aggregated in `VoteCollector.add_vote` when Vote2 quorum is reached (`vote_collector.rs:88-91`), stored in `DoubleCertificate.vote_extensions` (`engine.rs:1429`), and forwarded to the next round's `create_payload` via `BlockContext.vote_extensions` (`engine.rs:1682`, `view_protocol.rs:157`).

## 15. Long-term Vision: Substrate Pallets Dimensionality-Reduction Porting

> **Prerequisite:** All infrastructure ⚠️ items in sections 2–12 have been resolved to ✅. Security vulnerabilities (C-1..C-7) and engineering defects (H-1..H-12, R-1) are fully addressed. **This section is now unblocked for implementation.**

### 16.1 Strategic Rationale

Hotmint has a modern consensus core (HotStuff-2), high-performance async runtime (Tokio), and a clean stateless `Application` trait. However, building application-layer logic (tokens, PoS, governance) from scratch carries enormous engineering cost and audit risk.

Parity's (Polkadot) **Substrate FRAME Pallets** represent the industry's most complete and battle-tested pure-Rust blockchain business logic library, audited by top security firms over multiple years.

**Core approach:** Use LLM semantic extraction and code rewriting to strip Substrate's most stable Pallets of their macro system (`#[pallet::*]`) and Wasm/`no_std` constraints, porting them into Hotmint's `std` + `vsdb` + `serde` environment. This delivers production-grade business modules at minimal engineering cost.

### 16.2 Dimensionality-Reduction Mapping Rules

| Substrate (FRAME) Primitive | Hotmint Target | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `#[pallet::storage] StorageMap<K, V>` | `vsdb::MapxOrd<K, V>` | Strip macros, use vsdb persistent key-value storage directly |
| `DispatchError` / `#[pallet::error]` | `ruc::Result<()>` | Unified `ruc` chained error handling |
| `#[pallet::event]` | `hotmint_types::ReceiptLog` | Events become block execution receipt logs |
| `sp_runtime::traits::Currency` | Plain `std` Rust trait | Keep core abstractions, remove `no_std`/SCALE bindings |
| SCALE Codec (`Encode`/`Decode`) | `serde` (postcard/JSON) | Web-friendly standard serialization |
| `no_std` environment | `std` environment | Hotmint runs natively as an OS process, no Wasm boundary |
| `ensure_root` / `ensure_signed` | Transaction signer public key verification | Permission modifiers map to cryptographic identity checks |

### 16.3 Three-Phase Porting Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation Economy

**Goal:** A chain supporting account system, fungible token issuance, and transfers.

| Component | Source | Core Capabilities | Integration Point |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `pallet-balances` | Substrate | Balance management, transfer, reserve, lock | Called within `execute_block`, state written to vsdb |
| `pallet-assets` | Substrate | Multi-asset (ERC-20-like) mint, burn, freeze | Same as above |
| `pallet-timestamp` | Substrate | Block timestamp consensus | Integrates with `BlockContext.view` / proposer time |

**Prerequisites:** P0-1 (HTTP RPC) complete for dApp frontend interaction; C-2 (`gas_wanted`) complete for fee model support.

#### Phase 2: Governance & Native PoS Integration

**Goal:** Replace the current static `ValidatorSet` with a real DPoS/PoS economic model.

| Component | Source | Core Capabilities | Integration Point |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `pallet-staking` | Substrate | Nomination, validator election (Phragmen), slashing calculation | Drives epoch transitions via `EndBlockResponse.validator_updates` |
| `pallet-session` | Substrate | Key rotation and validator set updates at epoch boundaries | Integrates with `pending_epoch` mechanism |
| `pallet-multisig` | Substrate | Multisig wallets, delayed execution | `validate_tx` + `execute_block` |

**Prerequisites:** C-3 evidence on-chain complete (slashing requires on-chain verifiable equivocation proofs); `hotmint-staking` crate serves as porting base.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Contract Platform (Hotmint-EVM)

**Goal:** Full-featured AppChain / Rollup Sequencer with production-grade EVM compatibility.

| Component | Source | Core Capabilities | Integration Point |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `revm` | Reth ecosystem | Industry-leading EVM execution engine | Implement `revm::Database` trait for vsdb, embed in `execute_block` |
| `alloy-rlp` / `alloy-primitives` | Reth ecosystem | Ethereum transaction RLP decoding, signature recovery | Transaction parsing in `validate_tx` layer |
| Custom Precompiles | Custom bridge | Bridge EVM to native economic layer | Expose native functions (staking/governance) to Solidity contracts |

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 account/balance system as native token backend for EVM; existing `examples/evm-chain` (using `revm`) serves as reference implementation.

> **Detailed implementation plan in Section 16.5 (Hotmint-EVM Hybrid Architecture Roadmap).**

### 16.4 Implementation Standards

1. **AI Prompt Template Library:** Develop standardized prompt templates — input: Substrate source code; output: Hotmint-conformant `vsdb` + `Application` trait code
2. **State Root Integrity:** All state mutations must write through `vsdb` to ensure correct `app_hash` computation
3. **Security Audit Transfer:** Although business logic originates from audited Substrate code, ported code requires secondary security review, focusing on:
   - Integer overflow checks (`checked_add`/`checked_sub`) preserved completely
   - Permission modifiers correctly mapped to transaction signer public key verification
   - Storage key namespaces properly isolated (no cross-pallet state pollution)

### 16.5 Concrete Target: Production-Grade EVM-Compatible Chain

> The EVM chain has been extracted into the **[nbnet](https://github.com/NBnet/nbnet)** repository.
> Full architecture documentation, component mapping, implementation roadmap, and production gap analysis have moved there:
>
> 📖 **[nbnet/docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/NBnet/nbnet/blob/master/docs/architecture.md)**

### 16.6 Competitive Positioning

Post-completion Hotmint ecosystem position:

| Dimension | vs CometBFT/Tendermint | vs Cosmos SDK |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| Consensus | HotStuff-2: lower latency, no GC tail-latency jitter | — |
| Business Logic | — | AI-ported Substrate Pallets: pure Rust, type-safe, no Keeper/Handler nesting |
| Smart Contracts | — | Native EVM compatibility via revm (industry-leading EVM engine) + Substrate Pallets native economic model |
| Positioning | High-performance AppChain consensus engine | Next-gen AppChain + Rollup Sequencer full-stack solution (best-in-class versatility) |

## 18. Third-Round Full Codebase Audit (2026-04-07)

> **Audit Scope:** Full codebase (~16K LOC), all crates
> **Methodology:** Parallel subsystem audit per `.claude/docs/review-core.md`
> **Auditor:** Claude Code (automated deep analysis)
> **Findings:** 12 total (0 critical, 5 high, 5 medium, 2 low)

### 18.1 Summary

| Subsystem | Findings | Severity |
|-----------|:--------:|----------|
| Network | 2 | HIGH, MEDIUM |
| Storage | 3 | HIGH, HIGH, HIGH |
| API & ABCI | 3 | HIGH, MEDIUM, MEDIUM |
| Consensus | 1 | MEDIUM |
| Crypto | 1 | MEDIUM |
| Staking | 1 | LOW |
| Mgmt | 1 | LOW |
| Consensus core, Pacemaker, Sync, Mempool, Light client | 0 | Clean |

### 18.2 Findings

#### [x] A3-1. PeerMap Bidirectional Consistency Bug `[HIGH — Network]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-network/src/service.rs` — `PeerMap::insert`
**What:** `insert(vid, new_pid)` updates the forward map `validator_to_peer[vid] → new_pid` and inserts the new reverse mapping `peer_to_validator[new_pid] → vid`, but does NOT remove the stale reverse mapping `peer_to_validator[old_pid] → vid`. After a validator reconnects with a new PeerId, messages from the old PeerId are misattributed.
**Invariant:** INV-N2 (PeerMap bidirectional consistency). Cascades into `handle_epoch_change` — `remove(vid)` only cleans up the current reverse mapping, not any stale ones.
**Fix:**
```rust
pub fn insert(&mut self, vid: ValidatorId, pid: PeerId) {
    if let Some(old_pid) = self.validator_to_peer.insert(vid, pid) {
        self.peer_to_validator.remove(&old_pid);
    }
    self.peer_to_validator.insert(pid, vid);
}
```

---

#### [x] A3-2. Evidence Store Not Fsynced `[HIGH — Storage]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-storage/src/evidence_store.rs` — `put_evidence`, `persist_next_id`
**What:** `put_evidence()` writes to vsdb but `persist_next_id()` uses `std::fs::write()` without `sync_all()`. No `flush()` method exists on the `EvidenceStore` trait. `vsdb_flush()` is never called after evidence operations. A crash loses equivocation evidence — Byzantine validator escapes slashing.
**Invariant:** INV-ST4 (evidence persistence). Pattern 6.3 (evidence not crash-safe).
**Fix:** Add `sync_all()` to `persist_next_id()`. Add `flush()` to the `EvidenceStore` trait. Call `flush()` from the engine after `put_evidence()`.

---

#### [x] A3-3. Block Store put_block Not Atomic `[HIGH — Storage]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-storage/src/block_store.rs` — `put_block`
**What:** Two separate vsdb inserts (`by_height`, then `by_hash`) are not atomic. A crash after the first insert but before the second leaves an inconsistent state: `get_block_by_height()` returns a hash for a block that doesn't exist in `by_hash`.
**Invariant:** INV-ST2 (block store consistency). Pattern 6.2.
**Fix:** Reverse the order (insert `by_hash` first, then `by_height`) so that partial writes cause "not found by height" (recoverable) rather than "dangling hash reference" (inconsistent). Or wrap in a vsdb transaction if supported.

---

#### [x] A3-4. Evidence Not Flushed Before Consensus State Persist `[HIGH — Storage]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-consensus/src/engine.rs` — `process_commit_result`
**What:** `ev_store.mark_committed()` modifies vsdb maps but no flush follows. Then `persist_state()` flushes consensus state. A crash between evidence modification and consensus state flush loses evidence while consensus state survives.
**Invariant:** INV-ST4 combined with INV-ST1.
**Fix:** Add `ev_store.flush()` before `persist_state()`.

---

#### [x] A3-5. WebSocket Connection Limit TOCTOU Race `[HIGH — API]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-api/src/http_rpc.rs` — `ws_upgrade_handler`
**What:** The handler checks `ws_connection_count` then increments it later in `handle_ws` asynchronously. Multiple concurrent upgrade requests can all pass the check before any increment, exceeding `MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS = 1024`.
**Invariant:** INV-API2 (rate limiting). Check-then-act is non-atomic.
**Fix:** Use `compare_exchange` on the AtomicU64 to atomically check-and-increment, or acquire a semaphore permit before accepting the upgrade.

---

#### [x] A3-6. Missing Double Certificate View Ordering Validation `[MEDIUM — Consensus]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-consensus/src/engine.rs` — `validate_double_cert`
**What:** Validates same block hash and 2f+1 signatures for both QCs, but does not validate `outer_qc.view >= inner_qc.view`. A malformed DC with reversed view ordering could pass validation.
**Invariant:** INV-CS3 (DC validity requires QC2.view == QC1.view + 1). Missing defense-in-depth check.
**Fix:** Add `if dc.outer_qc.view < dc.inner_qc.view { return false; }`.

---

#### [x] A3-7. Ed25519 Signature Malleability — Non-Canonical S Accepted `[MEDIUM — Crypto]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-crypto/src/signer.rs` — `verify`
**What:** ed25519-dalek 2.2 default verification does not reject non-canonical signatures (where scalar S >= group order). Two different byte sequences can verify for the same (key, message). Current equivocation detection uses semantic content (not signature bytes) so practical impact is limited, but this violates INV-CR2.
**Invariant:** INV-CR2 (signature strictness / malleability protection). Pattern 7.3.
**Fix:** Enable `strict_signatures` feature: `ed25519-dalek = { ..., features = ["strict_signatures"] }`.

#### [x] A3-8. Relay Dedup Truncates Blake3 Hash to 8 Bytes `[MEDIUM — Network]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-network/src/service.rs` — relay deduplication
**What:** Relay message deduplication uses only the first 8 bytes of blake3 output (64-bit). With ~10K messages in the active set, birthday-bound collision probability becomes non-negligible, causing legitimate consensus messages to be silently dropped. Mempool dedup correctly uses full 32-byte hash.
**Invariant:** INV-N4 (correct dedup).
**Fix:** Use full 32-byte hash: `seen_active: HashSet<[u8; 32]>`.

#### [x] A3-9. Silent Hash Truncation/Padding in ABCI Protobuf Deserialization `[MEDIUM — ABCI]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-abci-proto/src/convert.rs` — `bytes_to_hash`
**What:** `bytes_to_hash` silently truncates or zero-pads hash fields that aren't exactly 32 bytes. A malformed ABCI message with a 16-byte hash would be padded with zeros and accepted, corrupting cryptographic integrity.
**Invariant:** INV-API3 (frame integrity). Cryptographic fields must be strictly validated.
**Fix:** Return `Err` instead of silently padding.

#### [x] A3-10. Application Error Messages Exposed in RPC Responses `[MEDIUM — API]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-api/src/rpc.rs`
**What:** Internal application errors are forwarded verbatim to untrusted clients via `format!("query failed: {e}")`. An attacker can craft inputs to extract internal state details.
**Invariant:** Information leakage to untrusted clients.
**Fix:** Return generic error messages to clients; log detailed errors server-side only.

---

#### [x] A3-11. ValidatorId Not Derived From Public Key `[LOW — Staking]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint/src/bin/node.rs` — ValidatorId lookup
**What:** ValidatorId is assigned manually via `--validator_id` flag and looked up in genesis, rather than derived deterministically from the public key (e.g., `hash(pubkey)`). Different genesis documents could assign different IDs to the same key.
**Invariant:** INV-CR5 (key derivation determinism).
**Fix:** Derive ValidatorId from public key hash at registration time.

---

#### [x] A3-12. Missing SAFETY Comments on Unsafe Blocks `[LOW — Mgmt]`

**Where:** `crates/hotmint-mgmt/src/local.rs` — two `libc::kill` blocks
**What:** Both `unsafe` blocks lack required `// SAFETY:` documentation. The code is sound (PIDs are triple-validated: `read_pid` + `is_running` + `is_cluster_node`), but the project convention requires explicit safety justification.
**Invariant:** Project convention (no undocumented unsafe).
**Fix:** Add `// SAFETY:` comments explaining the invariants.

### 18.3 Clean Areas

| Subsystem | What Was Verified |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Consensus core** | INV-CS1 (voting safety), INV-CS2 (2f+1 quorum), INV-CS4 (commit completeness), INV-CS5 (view monotonicity), INV-CS7 (epoch/view validation); vote dedup; equivocation detection |
| **Pacemaker** | INV-CS6 all three guarantees (fires per view, exponential backoff 1.5x capped 30s, reset on view change) |
| **Sync** | Cursor advances after each batch; terminates when caught up; no infinite loop; no interference with active consensus |
| **Mempool** | INV-MP1 (ordering consistency), INV-MP2 (no duplicates), INV-MP3 (eviction correctness), INV-MP4 (RBF atomicity); lock ordering correct |
| **Light client** | INV-CR3 (batch verification all-or-nothing); height monotonicity; hash chain verification |
| **Domain separation** | INV-CR1 — all 5 message types (Vote, Proposal, Prepare, Wish, Status) include chain_id, epoch, view, type tag |
| **Epoch transitions** | Atomic; +2 view delay correct; slashing verified before penalty; unbonding prevents slash evasion |
| **ABCI framing** | INV-API3 — 64MB bound; length validated before allocation |
| **API read-only** | INV-API1 — no write locks in RPC handlers |
| **Concurrency** | No parking_lot guards across .await; all channels bounded on consensus path; select! branches cancel-safe |
