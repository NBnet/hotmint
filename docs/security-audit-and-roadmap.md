## 1. Executive Summary

| Dimension | CometBFT v0.38 | Hotmint v0.8 |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Language | Go | Rust |
| Consensus Algorithm | Tendermint (three-phase BFT) | HotStuff-2 (two-chain commit BFT) |
| Maturity | Production-grade, primary engine of Cosmos ecosystem | Architecturally complete, core feature parity achieved, entering production hardening phase |
| Core Strengths | Complete ecosystem, rich toolchain, mature protocol | Lower latency, more modular architecture, memory safety |
| Main Weaknesses | Three-phase voting latency, Go GC tail-latency jitter | Missing IBC cross-chain protocol; ecosystem tooling still maturing |

Hotmint's combination of **Rust + HotStuff-2 + litep2p** gives it the potential to surpass CometBFT in core consensus algorithm and architectural modernization. All security vulnerabilities and engineering defects from all three audit rounds have been resolved (C-1..C-7, H-1..H-12, R-1, A-1..A-8, B-1..B-3, second-round C-1..C-5). All feature roadmap items are complete. Core feature parity with CometBFT has been achieved — the only remaining gap is:
- **Ecosystem Expansion Layer:** IBC cross-chain protocol (infrastructure ready, protocol not implemented)

## 13. Feature Evolution Items

All security vulnerabilities and engineering defects from all three audit rounds have been resolved. The items below document the completed feature roadmap.

---

### 🟢 P0 — Feature Evolution: Production Chain Essentials

#### [x] P0-1. Standard HTTP/WebSocket RPC + Event Subscription ✅

`HttpRpcServer` (`crates/hotmint-api/src/http_rpc.rs`) provides axum HTTP `POST /` + WS `GET /ws` with event bus, `SubscribeFilter`, and all standard RPC methods. The node binary starts it conditionally on `config.rpc.http_laddr` (`crates/hotmint/src/bin/node.rs:478-494`). The legacy TCP `RpcServer` remains for CLI tooling compatibility.

---

### 🟢 P1 — Feature Evolution: Network Robustness

#### [x] P1-1. Snapshot State Sync (State Sync via Snapshots) ✅

All 4 `Application` trait methods (`list_snapshots`, `load_snapshot_chunk`, `offer_snapshot`, `apply_snapshot_chunk`) are implemented. `sync_to_tip()` calls `sync_via_snapshot()` automatically when the catch-up gap exceeds `MAX_SYNC_BATCH` (`crates/hotmint-consensus/src/sync.rs:83-103`). The snapshot trust anchor is verified by fetching the signed anchor block and performing full QC aggregate-signature + quorum checks before adopting any snapshot state (`sync.rs:333-391`). The node binary serves snapshot chunks to peers and the sync client path is fully wired.

---

#### [x] P1-2. Weighted Proposer Selection `[Missing Feature]` ✅

**Current Gap:** `view % validator_count` does not consider staking weight, making it unfair for non-uniform stake distributions.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Enable the `voting_power` field in `ValidatorSet`
- Implement a CometBFT-style weighted round-robin algorithm (increment each validator's priority score proportionally to `voting_power`, select the highest scorer as proposer)
- Maintain backward compatibility with the existing Epoch structure

**Key Files:** `crates/hotmint-consensus/src/leader.rs`, `crates/hotmint-types/src/validator.rs`

---

### 🟢 P2 — Feature Evolution: Ecosystem Expansion

#### [x] P2-1. Light Client Verification Protocol `[Missing Feature]` ✅

**Current Gap:** Cannot support IBC cross-chain communication or trustless verification on mobile wallets.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Design a light client verification path based on existing `QuorumCertificate` (already contains 2f+1 aggregate signatures)
- `get_block` RPC optionally returns `commit_qc` + Merkle proof
- Add a `verify_header` RPC (verifies only QC signatures and validator set changes)
- Provide a standalone `hotmint-light` crate for third-party integration

**Key Files:** `crates/hotmint-api/`, `crates/hotmint-types/src/certificate.rs`

> **Implementation Status: ✅ Complete.** `hotmint-light` crate (`LightClient` + `verify_header` + `update_validator_set`, with unit tests); RPC `get_header` / `get_commit_qc` methods; MPT state proof verification via vsdb `MptProof` fully wired.

---

#### [x] P2-2. ABCI++ Vote Extensions `[Missing Feature]`

**Current Gap:** Cannot implement built-in oracles, threshold signature aggregation, or anti-MEV mechanisms.

**Recommended Implementation:**
- Add `extension: Option<Vec<u8>>` to the `Vote` struct
- Add two application callbacks before the `Vote2` phase:
  ```rust
  fn extend_vote(&self, block: &Block, ctx: &BlockContext) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;
  fn verify_vote_extension(&self, ext: &[u8], validator: ValidatorId) -> bool;
  ```
- Aggregate all validators' extensions in the `Double Certificate`
- The next round's `create_payload` can read the previous round's extension set

**Key Files:** `crates/hotmint-types/src/message.rs`, `crates/hotmint-consensus/src/view_protocol.rs`

> **Implementation Status: ✅ Complete.** `Vote.extension: Option<Vec<u8>>` field, `extend_vote()` / `verify_vote_extension()` callbacks, engine calls `extend_vote` before Vote2, `verify_vote_extension` called on receipt. Extensions are aggregated in `VoteCollector.add_vote` when Vote2 quorum is reached (`vote_collector.rs:88-91`), stored in `DoubleCertificate.vote_extensions` (`engine.rs:1429`), and forwarded to the next round's `create_payload` via `BlockContext.vote_extensions` (`engine.rs:1682`, `view_protocol.rs:157`).

## 15. Long-term Vision: Substrate Pallets Dimensionality-Reduction Porting

> **Prerequisite:** All infrastructure ⚠️ items in sections 2–12 have been resolved to ✅. Security vulnerabilities (C-1..C-7) and engineering defects (H-1..H-12, R-1) are fully addressed. **This section is now unblocked for implementation.**

### 16.1 Strategic Rationale

Hotmint has a modern consensus core (HotStuff-2), high-performance async runtime (Tokio), and a clean stateless `Application` trait. However, building application-layer logic (tokens, PoS, governance) from scratch carries enormous engineering cost and audit risk.

Parity's (Polkadot) **Substrate FRAME Pallets** represent the industry's most complete and battle-tested pure-Rust blockchain business logic library, audited by top security firms over multiple years.

**Core approach:** Use LLM semantic extraction and code rewriting to strip Substrate's most stable Pallets of their macro system (`#[pallet::*]`) and Wasm/`no_std` constraints, porting them into Hotmint's `std` + `vsdb` + `serde` environment. This delivers production-grade business modules at minimal engineering cost.

### 16.2 Dimensionality-Reduction Mapping Rules

| Substrate (FRAME) Primitive | Hotmint Target | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `#[pallet::storage] StorageMap<K, V>` | `vsdb::MapxOrd<K, V>` | Strip macros, use vsdb persistent key-value storage directly |
| `DispatchError` / `#[pallet::error]` | `ruc::Result<()>` | Unified `ruc` chained error handling |
| `#[pallet::event]` | `hotmint_types::ReceiptLog` | Events become block execution receipt logs |
| `sp_runtime::traits::Currency` | Plain `std` Rust trait | Keep core abstractions, remove `no_std`/SCALE bindings |
| SCALE Codec (`Encode`/`Decode`) | `serde` (postcard/JSON) | Web-friendly standard serialization |
| `no_std` environment | `std` environment | Hotmint runs natively as an OS process, no Wasm boundary |
| `ensure_root` / `ensure_signed` | Transaction signer public key verification | Permission modifiers map to cryptographic identity checks |

### 16.3 Three-Phase Porting Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation Economy

**Goal:** A chain supporting account system, fungible token issuance, and transfers.

| Component | Source | Core Capabilities | Integration Point |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `pallet-balances` | Substrate | Balance management, transfer, reserve, lock | Called within `execute_block`, state written to vsdb |
| `pallet-assets` | Substrate | Multi-asset (ERC-20-like) mint, burn, freeze | Same as above |
| `pallet-timestamp` | Substrate | Block timestamp consensus | Integrates with `BlockContext.view` / proposer time |

**Prerequisites:** P0-1 (HTTP RPC) complete for dApp frontend interaction; C-2 (`gas_wanted`) complete for fee model support.

#### Phase 2: Governance & Native PoS Integration

**Goal:** Replace the current static `ValidatorSet` with a real DPoS/PoS economic model.

| Component | Source | Core Capabilities | Integration Point |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `pallet-staking` | Substrate | Nomination, validator election (Phragmen), slashing calculation | Drives epoch transitions via `EndBlockResponse.validator_updates` |
| `pallet-session` | Substrate | Key rotation and validator set updates at epoch boundaries | Integrates with `pending_epoch` mechanism |
| `pallet-multisig` | Substrate | Multisig wallets, delayed execution | `validate_tx` + `execute_block` |

**Prerequisites:** C-3 evidence on-chain complete (slashing requires on-chain verifiable equivocation proofs); `hotmint-staking` crate serves as porting base.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Contract Platform (Hotmint-EVM)

**Goal:** Full-featured AppChain / Rollup Sequencer with production-grade EVM compatibility.

| Component | Source | Core Capabilities | Integration Point |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `revm` | Reth ecosystem | Industry-leading EVM execution engine | Implement `revm::Database` trait for vsdb, embed in `execute_block` |
| `alloy-rlp` / `alloy-primitives` | Reth ecosystem | Ethereum transaction RLP decoding, signature recovery | Transaction parsing in `validate_tx` layer |
| Custom Precompiles | Custom bridge | Bridge EVM to native economic layer | Expose native functions (staking/governance) to Solidity contracts |

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 account/balance system as native token backend for EVM; existing `examples/evm-chain` (using `revm`) serves as reference implementation.

> **Detailed implementation plan in Section 16.5 (Hotmint-EVM Hybrid Architecture Roadmap).**

### 16.4 Implementation Standards

1. **AI Prompt Template Library:** Develop standardized prompt templates — input: Substrate source code; output: Hotmint-conformant `vsdb` + `Application` trait code
2. **State Root Integrity:** All state mutations must write through `vsdb` to ensure correct `app_hash` computation
3. **Security Audit Transfer:** Although business logic originates from audited Substrate code, ported code requires secondary security review, focusing on:
   - Integer overflow checks (`checked_add`/`checked_sub`) preserved completely
   - Permission modifiers correctly mapped to transaction signer public key verification
   - Storage key namespaces properly isolated (no cross-pallet state pollution)

### 16.5 Concrete Target: Production-Grade EVM-Compatible Chain (Hotmint-EVM)

> **Entry Point:** The specific goal is to "build a fully-featured, production-ready EVM-compatible chain on top of Hotmint," driving practical validation of Substrate component porting and Reth ecosystem integration.

#### 16.5.1 Technology Stack Evaluation: Substrate (Frontier/SputnikVM) vs Reth (revm/alloy)

| Evaluation Dimension | Substrate Ecosystem (Frontier/SputnikVM) | Reth Ecosystem (revm/alloy) | Conclusion |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|------|
| Design Era | 2019–2020, bound to `no_std` + Wasm constraints | 2022–present, native `std` environment, modern API | 🏆 Reth |
| Execution Performance | Moderate (memory allocation bottleneck) | Industry benchmark (Paradigm/OP Stack/Arbitrum have all migrated to revm) | 🏆 Reth |
| Underlying Types | `sp-core` / `primitive-types` + SCALE encoding | `alloy-primitives` (high-performance U256/Address) + `alloy-rlp` | 🏆 Reth |
| Substrate Component Compatibility | Very high (Precompile natively interoperates with pallet-balances, etc.) | Low (requires custom bridging) | 🏆 Substrate |
| AI Porting Difficulty | High (must strip `#[pallet]` macros + Wasm boundary) | Very low (pure Rust library, implement `Database` trait with ~4 methods to integrate with vsdb) | 🏆 Reth |

**Conclusion: Hybrid Approach is optimal** — EVM execution layer embraces the Reth ecosystem (revm + alloy), while the native economic system and governance model retain AI-ported Substrate Pallets. The two are bridged through Custom Precompiles.

#### 16.5.2 Architecture Component Mapping

| Substrate / Frontier Component | Hotmint-EVM Target Architecture | Core Responsibility |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `pallet-timestamp` | `hotmint_evm::Timestamp` | Provides current block time for the EVM `block.timestamp` opcode |
| `pallet-balances` | `hotmint_evm::Balances` | Manages native token, handles Gas deduction and native transfers (AI-ported from Substrate) |
| `pallet-evm` (SputnikVM) | ~~Not used~~ → `revm` crate | Direct revm integration, implement `revm::Database` trait for vsdb |
| `pallet-ethereum` | `alloy-rlp` + `alloy-primitives` | Ethereum RLP transaction decoding (EIP-1559/EIP-2930), `ecrecover` signature recovery |
| `fc-rpc` (Frontier RPC) | `hotmint_api::Web3Rpc` (`jsonrpsee`) | Standard `eth_*` JSON-RPC interface, MetaMask-compatible |
| Substrate Storage Trie | `vsdb::MapxOrd` & `Mapx` | Account Nonce/Balance, EVM Code (contract bytecode), EVM Storage (contract state) |
| `pallet-staking` | `hotmint_evm::Staking` (AI-ported) | DPoS staking/validator election/slashing (native layer, exposed to EVM via Precompile) |

#### 16.5.3 Hybrid Execution Roadmap (5 Phases)

**Phase 1: Underlying Native Economic System (AI-Ported from Substrate)** ✅
- ~~Use AI to port `pallet-balances` to vsdb~~ → `hotmint-evm-state` (`EvmState`): vsdb-backed account balance, nonce, code, storage
- ~~Introduce `U256` safe arithmetic~~ → via `alloy-primitives::U256`
- ~~Build EVM world state structure~~ → `EvmState` with vsdb `CacheDB` adapter for revm
- ~~Implement `Timestamp` and `BlockContext`~~ → `BlockContext` carries height, gas_limit, coinbase, timestamp

**Phase 2: Introduce Reth Core Primitives (Alloy)** ✅
- ~~Introduce `alloy-primitives`, `alloy-rlp`~~ → `hotmint-evm-types` crate
- ~~`validate_tx`: RLP decode → ecrecover → ChainID → Nonce → Balance~~ → `tx::decode_and_recover()` + `tx::validate_tx()`
- ~~Cryptography~~ → `k256` crate for secp256k1 ECDSA recovery

**Phase 3: Integrate the Leading Execution Engine (Revm)** ✅
- ~~Implement `revm::Database` trait for vsdb~~ → `EvmState` provides `CacheDB` for revm
- ~~`execute_block`: revm → batch-write~~ → `EvmExecutor::execute_block()` in `hotmint-evm-execution`
- ~~Gas settlement~~ → max fee deducted pre-execution, refund after, proposer reward
- ~~Events and logs~~ → `EvmReceipt` with logs persisted per block
- ~~app_hash determinism~~ → `BTreeMap` + vsdb `MapxOrd` for state root

**Phase 4: Cross-Layer Bridging (Precompile Interoperability)** ✅
- ~~Implement `revm::Precompile` interface~~ → `hotmint-evm-precompile` crate
- ~~Address `0x0800` → Staking module~~ → `SharedStakingState` bridging EVM to `hotmint-staking`

**Phase 5: Expose Web3 API (Alloy/Reth RPC)** ✅ (Basic)
- ~~Build HTTP server~~ → `hotmint-evm-rpc` (axum-based)
- ~~Standard Ethereum APIs~~ → `eth_chainId`, `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getBalance`, `eth_getTransactionCount`, `eth_getCode`, `eth_getStorageAt`, `eth_gasPrice`, `eth_estimateGas`, `eth_sendRawTransaction`, `eth_getBlockByNumber`, `eth_feeHistory`, `eth_syncing`, `net_version`, `web3_clientVersion`
- ~~Compatible with MetaMask, Hardhat, Foundry~~ → basic compatibility achieved
- **Remaining:** `eth_call` (dry-run), `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt` (full), `eth_getTransactionByHash` (full) — currently return stubs

#### 16.5.4 Key Risks and Pitfalls

1. **State Reversion Consistency:** When an EVM transaction reverts or runs out of Gas, state changes must be rolled back while preserving Gas deduction. Approach: create a transient snapshot via vsdb Write Batch before each transaction; discard on failure, commit on success.
2. **Mempool RBF and Ethereum Nonce Conflicts:** Ethereum nonces are strictly incrementing; `validate_tx` must verify `nonce >= account_nonce`, and the Mempool needs `(sender, nonce)` deduplication and RBF replacement logic.
3. **App Hash Determinism:** `HashMap` traversal is unordered, which causes `app_hash` inconsistency between nodes, leading to chain fork and halt. Strictly use `BTreeMap` / `vsdb::MapxOrd` with ordered traversal.
4. **Prerequisites:** All infrastructure ⚠️ items have been resolved to ✅. EVM integration can proceed once Phase 1 (native economic system) is stable.

#### 16.5.5 Acceptance Milestone

MetaMask successfully connects to Hotmint-EVM and completes a transfer or contract deployment — this serves as the minimum validation that Phases 1–4 are functional end-to-end.

> **Status:** E2E test (`crates/evm/node/tests/e2e_rpc.rs`) validates a 4-node cluster with EIP-1559 transfer submission via JSON-RPC. The benchmark (`bench-evm`) measures confirmed-on-chain TPS. MetaMask basic connectivity is possible but full wallet workflow (receipt tracking, block explorer) requires completing `eth_call`, `eth_getLogs`, and full receipt/tx-by-hash responses.

## 17. Hotmint-EVM Production Gap Analysis

> **As of v0.8.3:** All identified production gaps have been resolved. The EVM chain has feature parity with the standard hotmint-node for consensus infrastructure, and implements all essential Ethereum JSON-RPC methods.

### 17.1 Completed

| Feature | Implementation | Crate |
|:--------|:--------------|:------|
| EVM execution via revm | `EvmExecutor` implements `Application` trait | `hotmint-evm-execution` |
| EIP-1559 transaction pool | `EvmTxPool` with sender/nonce ordering, RBF, tip priority | `hotmint-evm-txpool` |
| Pluggable mempool | `MempoolAdapter` trait, `EvmMempoolAdapter` wraps `EvmTxPool` | `hotmint-mempool`, `hotmint-evm-execution` |
| Transaction gossip | `NetworkSink::broadcast_tx()` on RPC submit + gossip receive loop | `hotmint-consensus`, `hotmint-evm-rpc`, `hotmint-evm-node` |
| Nonce-fn wiring | `EvmExecutor::setup_nonce_fn()` connects txpool to committed state | `hotmint-evm-execution` |
| Ethereum JSON-RPC | 22 methods (eth_*, net_*, web3_*) via axum | `hotmint-evm-rpc` |
| Staking precompile | `0x0800` → `hotmint-staking` via `SharedStakingState` | `hotmint-evm-precompile` |
| Cluster management | `init_evm_cluster()`, `start_evm_nodes()`, `kill_stale_nodes()` | `hotmint-evm-node`, `hotmint-mgmt` |
| TPS benchmark | Nonce-confirmed on-chain throughput measurement | `hotmint-evm-node` (bench-evm) |
| State persistence | vsdb-backed EVM state with MPT state root | `hotmint-evm-state` |

### 17.2 EVM Node Infrastructure — All Resolved

| # | Gap | Resolution |
|---|:----|:-----------|
| E-1 | Fullnode mode | Nodes not in genesis auto-detect as fullnode (`ValidatorId(u64::MAX)` sentinel) |
| E-2 | Block sync on startup | `sync_to_tip()` runs from peers before consensus starts |
| E-3 | Sync responder | Returns real height/view/epoch via `ConsensusStatus` watch channel |
| E-4 | `init` subcommand | `hotmint-evm init --home ...` generates keys + config + evm-genesis.json |
| E-5 | Graceful shutdown | `tokio::select!` supervisor with ctrl_c + SIGTERM handlers |
| E-6 | WAL | `ConsensusWal::open()` for crash-safe commit recovery |
| E-7 | Evidence store | `PersistentEvidenceStore::open()` for equivocation proof persistence |
| E-8 | CLI overrides | `--rpc-addr`, `--p2p-laddr` override config.toml values |
| E-9 | Config respect | `serve_rpc`, `serve_sync` flags control server startup |

### 17.3 Ethereum JSON-RPC — All Resolved

| # | Method | Implementation |
|---|:-------|:---------------|
| R-1 | `eth_call` | Dry-run EVM execution via `EvmExecutor::eth_call()` (read-only `transact_one`) |
| R-2 | `eth_getTransactionReceipt` | Full receipt: status, gasUsed, logs, effectiveGasPrice, contractAddress |
| R-3 | `eth_getTransactionByHash` | Tx lookup from receipt data (hash, from, to, blockNumber) |
| R-4 | `eth_getLogs` | Filter logs by address and topic across all blocks |
| R-5 | `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Block with real height and transaction count |
| R-6 | `eth_estimateGas` | Dry-run execution via `eth_call` for gas estimation |
